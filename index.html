              The ambience of the college has always been so positive and
              encourages to learn. It was a great time, spent in RIT.
              RIT-Mechanical has very wonderful faculty and they are very
              cooperative. The relation between faculty and student is very
              cordial, which gave me an opportunity to excel further.
